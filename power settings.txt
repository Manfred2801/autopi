I am using the following under “settings/advanced/power”:

Critical Level
    Duration = 180
    Voltage = 12.3
Safety Cut-out
    Duration = 150
    Voltage = 12.20
Event Driven
    Delay = 120
    Event Regex = ^vehicle/pwr/off
    Period = 600
Suppress
    Event Regex = ^vehicle/pwr/on
Wake Trigger
    Voltage Change = +0.40
    Voltage Change Duration = 2000ms
    Voltage Level > 13.30
